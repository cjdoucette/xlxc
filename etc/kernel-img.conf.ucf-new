# want the symbolic link.  Please note that this is not a Boolean
# variable.  This may be of help to loadlin users, who may set both
# this and move_image. Defaults to /. This can be used in conjunction
# with all above options except link_in_boot, which would not make
# sense.  (If both image_dest and link_in_boot are set, link_in_boot
# overrides).
